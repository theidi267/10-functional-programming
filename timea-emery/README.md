## Overview
We are providing an online space for people to post their articles and read others in an organized and filterable space.

## Getting Started
a. Add express to your local directory so you can run the node server.
b. Install a postgres database functionality to your machine 
c. Paste the following URL into your browser: http://localhost:3000
d. Go this http://localhost:3000/new url and feel free to add a new article to our blog 
e. Visit http://localhost:3000/admin.html and you should be able to view our author stats. This will be completed when we have more time to complete it. 

## Architecture
The application architecture consists a host of languages including, html, css, and JavaScript as well as a few libraries including jQuery, Node.js, and Handlebars.js and we're using SQL as our backend database. This app also use a compiler called marked.js to increase speed as well as a packing mechanism used to pack all our js files into a single file.

## Change Log
